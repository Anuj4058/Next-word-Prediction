        "journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when\n",
        "my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered\n",

        "extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I\n",
        "looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette\n",
        "against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his\n",
        "head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who\n",
        "knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own\n",
        "story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created\n",
        "dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell\n",
        "and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.\n",
        "\n",
        "His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\n",
        "to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\n",
        "me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\n",
        "spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire\n",
        "and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n",

        "that you intended to go into harness.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Then, how do you know?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\n",
        "yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless\n",
        "servant girl?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have\n",
        "been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a\n",
        "country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I\n",
        "have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\n",
        "Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,\n",
        "again, I fail to see how you work it out.”\n",
        "\n",
        "He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n",
        "\n",
        "“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside\n",
        "of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is\n",
        "scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by\n",
        "someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in\n",
        "order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double\n",
        "deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a\n",
        "particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As\n",
        "to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of\n",
        "iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right\n",
        "forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where\n",
        "he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not\n",
        "pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\n",
        "process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,\n",
        "“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I\n",
        "could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your\n",
        "reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I\n",
        "believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\n",
        "down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The\n",
        "distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\n",
        "which lead up from the hall to this room.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Frequently.”\n",
        "\n",

        "“How many? I don’t know.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\n",
        "my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\n",
        "both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these\n",
        "little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two\n",
        "of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw\n",
        "over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open\n",
        "upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”\n",

        "The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n",
        "\n",
        "“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it\n",
        "said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very\n",
        "deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of\n",
        "Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\n",
        "matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\n",
        "This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\n",
        "chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\n",
        "wear a mask.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it\n",
        "means?”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has\n",
        "data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of\n",
        "theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from\n",
        "it?”\n",
        "\n",
        "I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\n",
        "written.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,\n",
        "endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not\n",
        "be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and\n",
        "stiff.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English\n",
        "paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”\n",
        "\n",
        "I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G”\n",
        "with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.\n",
        "\n",
        "“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’\n",
        "which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like\n",
        "our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us\n",
        "glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume\n",
        "from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a\n",
        "German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable\n",
        "as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous\n",
        "glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of\n",
        "that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud\n",
        "from his cigarette.\n",
        "\n",
        "“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the\n",
        "peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from\n",
        "all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written\n",
        "that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only\n",
        "remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who\n",
        "writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his\n",
        "face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our\n",
        "doubts.”\n",
        "\n",
        "As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating\n",
        "wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes\n",
        "whistled.\n",
        "\n",
        "“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of\n",
        "the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred\n",
        "and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there\n",
        "is nothing else.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“I think that I had better go, Holmes.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell.\n",
        "And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.”\n",
        "\n",
        "“But your client—”\n",
        "\n",
        "“Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes.\n",
        "Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.”\n",
        "\n",
        "A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the\n",
        "passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and\n",
        "authoritative tap.\n",
        "\n",
        "“Come in!” said Holmes.\n",
        "\n",
        "A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches\n",
        "in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich\n",
        "with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad\n",
        "taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and\n",
        "fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was\n",
        "thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and\n",
        "secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming\n",
        "beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were\n",
        "trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of\n",
        "barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He\n",
        "carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper\n",
        "part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard\n",
        "mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand\n",
        "was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face\n",
        "he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip,\n",
        "and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length\n",
        "of obstinacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "“You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly\n",
